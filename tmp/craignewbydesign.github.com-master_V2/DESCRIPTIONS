- Cnewby
Personal online graphic design and web design portfolio.  Created a portfolio/place for viewers to see my latest design and website designs.


- Nature Food Source
Created a landing page for a website that introduces you to the world of natural/organic food.  Deisgned the landing page with more of a natural/layered/collage look and feel.  The static full page background gives the page a more fresh/natural feel.


- Xondi Business Page
Gave the page more of a clean structured tech look and feel.  This lets you know that the company is serious and can be trusted with your business.     

- Cherry Blossoms
Using the power of Google Maps API.  Developed a single point of information for those interested in the Annual Spring Cherry Blossom Festival in Washington, DC.  The page was designed very simply with the theme being Cherry Blossoms.  There is also a simple single scaling effect to give the user more want to look deeper in to the Cherry Blossom festival.


-  Photo Gallery

Here I created a very simple photo gallery experience.  This was created to show how the "element of Blah" is used in user experience design.  


- Environment Good
This site was built using the power of Bootstrap.  Bootstrap is a very simple, clean, framework and greatly enhanced the speed of development.  



-  Mobile site for Cnewby
This mobile site was created for my original Design Portfolio cnewby.com.  I keep the site very clean with the original website theme in mind.  The overall experience is simple and engaging.


- Recipe App
The purpose of this app is simply to list recipes, ingredients, and steps.  It also uses the Google Maps API to locate ingredients that you may not have at your local grocery store.
This app was created to show the UI principles at a high level block mockup.  The goal was to create an app that flows following purely the principles of user interface design.  The app flows from page to page using only layout, color, and transitions.

- Ecommerce Simulation App

This app was created to simulate an online clothing/merchandise store from logging in to your own personal Account to Checkout of your items that you purchase.  The app shows how the UI design and interaction design principles can be used in the highest level of abstract form.  Everything from account login, to product display, to check out of the online store is created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
